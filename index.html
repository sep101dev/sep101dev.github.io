    <h1>Our Digital Portfolio (SEP 101)</h1>
    <h2>Made by Mark and Anthony</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Starting things off with Mark's Scratch game (Unit 1), this is the first
      time we were exposed to coding logic. Scratch is a block-based programming
      language and website and is very common for novice programmers. With it comes
      the simplest coding logic, like booleans, and conditionals, but also some more advanced topics such as functions and arithmetics. 
  
    </p>

      />
      <p>
        Within Mark's project is a multi-level maze game, in which first you must
        go through a door to find a golden apple, when you touch the golden apple, the size of 
        your sprite decreases, allowing you to go through the door you initially couldn't and go
        to the next level. In the second cave is a plethora of AI, some of who have a set motion,
        while others go to random spots at random speeds. The concept was inspired by Pac-Man.
        In the final cave is a giant crab, who is programmed to constantly follow you, and as the timer
        goes down, he gets faster. Eventually, around the end of the timer, when it seems as though the 
        crab is going too fast, an orange-colored apple appears and when touched makes the main sprite
        invincible, giving you the choice to defeat the final boss of the game. There are many details
        that I did not include within this paragraph, but that is only so you play the game yourself, 
        inside, and see what other sprites and AI are in this game.

        
        You can play the game

      <p>Anthony’s scratch game is taking a simple class assignment to the next level. The game is a 2D shooter, in which there is 1 tutorial level and three main levels. Each level has one sprite, slowly inching towards the player and shooting bullets, dealing progressively more damage over time. The player can also shoot projectiles, but what I find really interesting is the “power up” mode. In which by pressing the “T” key, the user goes into a transformation sprite before going into their super form, where the player deals more damage. It takes what we know as a simple idea, and takes it to the max on steroids, one can see the tedious work that went into the project, and this is an occurring  theme we will see with Anthony for the remainder of these projects.</p>

        Here we make our very first website with the help of Glitch and with
        the languages of HTML and CSS. In short, Glitch is a website used to make other
        websites, it uses the "Big Three"(dubbed by me), which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        On our website, we only use HTML and CSS, but that didn't stop us from creating aesthetically
        pleasing, and comprehensive websites. In Mark's website, it gives off a somewhat "all over the place"
        the vibe, and uses multiple tags to give off this look. At the top are some a crossed-out sentence telling
        you to give your social security number, as well as a form to submit, and a submit button.
        Seemingly in the middle of nowhere is a div asking you what your favorite color is. There's also an
        unordered list, a link, and a multitude of other things I will not discuss for the sake of the length 
        of this already long paragraph that literally nobody will read. if you want to see the rest of this website
        here's its code.

       The structure of this project and Mark’s are very similar on the outside, but the fundamentals, and the story both of them tell are idiosyncratic. Anthony’s project uses a form tag and submit button and it also has a space background. The project itself was not hard, and both Mark and Anthony enjoyed manipulating their digital art pieces. Even if you’ve seen Mark’s you should still check out Anthony’s, as it has its own “feeling”, different from Mark’s. Just as I talked about in Anthony’s scratch website, when viewing the code, the site looks incredibly simple. However, if you looked behind the scenes, even behind the source code you can see that Anthony has put multiple different things that seem very tedious or even outright meaningless, such as the need to make the big smiley face clickable, and it translates to the cat image at the bottom of the website. Just as before, simple yet elaborate.

        Here we dabbled in the world of Python, creating our first text-based
        programs.
      </p>
      <p>This is Mark's Python + Turtle project (Unit 3)</p>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/2bac30c8-fff4-4649-bd9c-76f412372be1/thumbnails%2Fturtle-sky.png?1652309833856"
      />
      <p>
        Turtle is a library in the popular coding language Python, it's used for geometric shapes, and programs that require drawings.
        Within the context of our class, we used it on the website repl.it, and learned to create drawings. In my project, I've created a scenery
        of the summer sky, the bright sun, and its orange rays, with 3 cyan clouds above it. The hardest part of this project was definitely trying to understand
        the concept that is geometric shapes and how they are formed, especially as someone who hasn't taken geometry class yet. This is also the first 
        instance of using an actual programming language. We learned the concept of the while loop, similar to the forever loop in Scratch. For a student 
        who finds this subject interesting (just look at this website), I am very glad to have been challenged in this unit.

      <br />
      <p> And yet again, Anthony’s project blows the standards away… Unlike the writer of this paragraph(Mark), Anthony has had prior knowledge of geometry, and may have found this project slightly easier than Mark. However, that still does not take away from the project. It’s a minecraft sword… that’s it. A fairly simple thing to do in replit, because of the jagged lines and sharp edges, and yet it still turned out better than the majority of his peers.The different colors of the handle and edge are also a neat touch. It’s fairly simple but you should definitely check it out.</p>

        This is a file called "Mood Radio" that allows you to transmit radio signals to other microbits near you. We used the website makecode.microbit to use create this “radio”. The website uses JavaScript and can be used in block or text-based. This project was actually much harder than expected, and while I finished all of it on time, it definitely took a little more brainpower to understand exactly what the instructions in the tutorial were saying, instead of just copying it down and not understanding any of it.

      <p>
        This is the code for Rock, Paper, Scissors, and requires 2 or more players. Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fairly common game to code for novices. It wasn’t nearly as complex as the mood radio, and really boiled down to a bunch of randomized variables, and gyroscopic sensors. Not as much brain power was needed with this one, but it’s still a necessary project for those who are looking to be a coding elitists (which Anthony was certainly thinking about at the time).

        The project is a seasonal calendar. It allows you to check what season
        it is outside and what month it is via LEDs.… or that’s how it was supposed to go. Arduino is a microcomputer that uses different components such as the potentiometer and LEDs, for our project, we built a clock and used 12 LEDs for the months and an LCD screen to display the time and day. The hardware side of the project did indeed work, however the software side, which I(Mark) was tasked with, didn’t go so well. Arduino’s IDE used C++, and it seemed to have a problem with the RTC library and other time libraries. The project was a half fail, but given enough time, I do believe we would have solved the issue.

        In this project, we visit scratch again and make a flappy bird-based project. My (Mark’s) project was surprisingly complex. Out of all the projects, I felt like this one was the project in which I learned the most about coding logic. It was a tassel getting many of the mechanics working, and I feel as though I could make a semi-game if I did this with an actual programming language. Inside the game are three levels, the third one sadly not being completed because Mark is a lazy bum. 
        As of the 9th grade, this is the most <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/681512541/">advanced we've gotten,</a> over the course of this year we've learned multiple skills useful in many fields of IT, some even used by professionals. I hope you enjoyed our Digital Portfolio for SEP 101.
