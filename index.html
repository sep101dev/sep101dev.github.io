    <h1>Our Digital Portfolio (SEP 101)</h1>
    <h2>Made by Mark and Anthony</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Starting things off with Mark's Scratch game (Unit 1), this is the first
      time we were exposed to coding logic. Scratch is a block-based programming
      language and website, and is very common for novice programmers to use. With it comes
      the simplest coding logic, like booleans, and conditonals, but also some more advanced topics
      such as functions and arithmetics. 
  
    </p>

      />
      <p>
        Within Mark's project is a muli-level maze game, in which first you must
        go through a door to find a golden apple, when you touch the golden apple, the size of 
        your sprite decreases, allowing you to go through the door you intially couldn't and go
        to the next level. In the second cave is a plethroa of AI, some who have a set motion,
        while others go to random spots at random speeds. The concept was inspired off of Pac-Man.
        In the final cave is a giant crab, who is programmed to constantly follow you, and as the timer
        goes down, he gets faster. Eventually around the end of the timer, when it seems as though the 
        crab is going too fast, an orange colored apple appears and when touched makes the main sprite
        invincible, giving you the choice to defeat the final boss of the game. There are many details
        that I did not include within this paragraph, but that is only so you play the game yourself, 
        inside, and see what other sprites and AI are in this game.
        
        You can play the game

        In here we make our very first website with the help of Glitch, and with
        the languages of HTML and CSS. In short, Glitch is a website used to make other
        websites, it uses the "Big Three"(dubbed by me), which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        In our website we only use HTML and CSS, but that didn't stop us from creating aesthetically
        pleasing, and comprehensive websites. In Mark's website, it gives off a somewhat "all over the place"
        vibe, and uses multiple tags to give off this look. At the top are some a crossed out sentence telling
        you to give your social security number, as well as a form to submit, and a submit button.
        Seemingly in the middle of nowhere is a div asking you what your favorite color is. There's also an
        unordered list,an link,and a multitude of other things I will not discuss for the sake of the length 
        this already long paragraph that literally nobody will read. if you want to see the rest of this website
        here's it's code.

        Here we dabbled in the world of Python, creating our first text-based
        programs.

      <p>This is Mark's Python + Turtle project (Unit 3)</p>

      <p>
        Turtle is a library in the popular coidng laguage Python, it's used for geometric shapes, and programs that require drawings.
        Within the context of our class, we used it on the website repl.it, and learned to create drawings. In my project, I've created a scenery
        of the summer sky, the bright sun and it's orange rays, with 3 cyan clouds above it. The hardest part of this project were definitely trying to understand
        the concept that is geometric shapes and how they are formed, especially as someone who hasn't taken geometry class yet. This is also the first 
        instance of using an actual programming language. We learned the concept of the while loop, similar to the forever loop in Scratch. For a student 
        finds this subject interesting (just look at this website) I am very glad to have been challenged in this unit.

        As of the 9th grade, this is the most <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/681512541/">advanced we've gotten,</a> over the course of this year we've learned multiple skills useful in many fields of IT, some even used by professionals. I hope you enjoyed our Digital Portfolio for SEP 101.
